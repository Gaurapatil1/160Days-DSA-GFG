# 160 Days of DSA – GeeksforGeeks (Python Track)

Welcome to my **160 Days of DSA Challenge** using **Python**, based on the curated roadmap from **GeeksforGeeks**. This journey focuses on mastering **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** to prepare for top internships and job opportunities.

---

## 📅 Structure

Each day consists of:
- `program.py` → Code for problems solved that day.
- `notes.py` → Concepts learned, explanations, tips, and useful links.

---

## ✅ Goals

- Build strong DSA fundamentals (Arrays to Graphs).
- Practice pattern-based problem solving.
- Maintain daily consistency with GitHub commits.
- Prepare for coding interviews and paid internships.
